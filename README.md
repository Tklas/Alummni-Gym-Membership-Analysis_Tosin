This analysis contains information about the membership for Allumni Gym, it contains information of each gym member, their age, abonnement type, number of times they visit the gym, if they have personal trainers etc. I have derived insights and also made a few recommendations on what i think can also aid in decision making for the gym.

Data Source: Kaggle.com

Tool: Ms Excel

Key Insights

From the dataset, it shows the following insights;

I notices that more gym members tend to visit the gym more on Fridays, this is probably due to the fact that its a weekend and people come after work and still have enough time to rest properly during the weekend

The gym members prefare the standard abonnement type as it has the highest membership, this is probably due to the affordable cost to most people as compared to the premium abonnemnet type.

People from the age range of 40 and above tend to visit the gym more, this is likely due to the fact that the older you get, the more you need to keep your health in check and physical well being and fitness is very important when getting older

I also noticed that there are more male gym members than female

Some gym members have personal trainers while others dont, there are a few personal trainers like Chantel, Jeffery, Mike etc. but Mike seems to stand out as he has the highest enrollee under him.
 

Recommendations

After carefully looking into these dataset and analysisng it and coming up with the above insights, here are a few recommendations i feel he gym can adopt to aid in making effective decisions, thy are listed below;

I recommend that more personal trainers be available on Fridays being the busiest day of the week at the gym and perhaps this would help them have an idea of peoples expectations and have a large number of people to make observations from that can help them meet the expectations of their members

There seems to be less number of members registered for the premium abonnement, thought i understand that this is designed specially for high class members but i recommend an additional incentive be added to this package to encourage other people registering for this type of abonnement because as we can see from the analysis it costs more which meand the more members the gym registered for the premium package, the more money they can generate.

Ensuring trainers are on ground to atted to their members needs and assist them with equipments around the gym

I also recommend making the gym environment and general ambience condusive and welcoming to al genders especially since the female gender dont seem to come to the gym as much as the male gender. The gym should be condusive fo both male and female gender.

I also recommend other personal trainers speak with mike and perhaps he coud share his strategies on how he has so much members he personally trains, what e does diefferently etc. so that other personal trainers can incorporate such into their routine.
 

With this analysis, i hope i have been able to show us a thorough visualization and analysis that could aid prompt and effective decision making.
